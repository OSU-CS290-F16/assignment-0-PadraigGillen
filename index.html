  <h3>Computer Science - Senior</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>On the provided scale, I rate myself a <strong>2/10</strong> in web development skills.</li>
    <li>I would like to learn the best practices of making a modern web page, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>proper styling using CSS (as opposed to slapping together a bunch of &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, and &lt;table&gt; tags)</li>
        <li>UX design</li>
        <li>implementing a responsive back end</li>
        <li>making the pages accessible to all users: desktop, mobile, screenreaders, bots, <strike>government agents</strike>....
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I am using Piazza.</li>
    <li>I have no idea what to put for this, so I'll just mention that I have voluntary nystagmus. This involves rapidly oscillating my pupils at will, which is a completely useless, but harmless, ability. Most people find it weird, so I wouldn't recommend looking it up if you are squeamish.</li>
