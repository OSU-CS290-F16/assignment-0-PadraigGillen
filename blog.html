  <h3><em>Getting up and running</em></h3>
  <h4>Challenges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The main challenges of this assignment involved using HTML properly to get a readable site without using CSS.</li>
    <li>I think this was a good experience for me as it forced me to focus on accurately labelling content, instead of formatting the text to match what I wanted it to look like.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Learning</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>I learned about the &lt;nav&gt; tag, as well as the importance of declaring the 'DOCTYPE' and 'charset'.</li>
    <li>I was familiar with all of the other HTML elements I used before and the proper hierarchy for them.</li>
    <li> I was also familiar with developing on <em>flip</em> and pushing frequently to Github.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Resources</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>As always, I heavily turned to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> to figure out the proper syntax and usage of tags.</li>
      <li>I used the Firefox <em>Inspect Element</em> tool to see how websites tended to lay out their articles.</li>
  </ul>
